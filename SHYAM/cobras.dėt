protein ([56g,98.3g] ÷ day); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)#Dietary_recommendations
	32.8 ÷ 1l soy milk (64%d*i*)
	17.7g ÷ 225g (420g c̄ liquid,..)) red kidney beans (36%d*i*)
	…50.5g is good enough; there's more in every"-thing" else anyway (i think rice has me covered)
calcium (1000mg ÷ day); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_in_biology#Dietary_recommendations
	1200mg ÷ 1l soy milk (300mg ÷ 250ml (152%r*d*i*?))
	…1200mg is more than enough

kōan shopping:
	never buy bulk; buy one ∧ if it's no good, buy another from elsewhere
	some parsimonious places (c*b*r*) won't give you bags for free, but other places (s*y*d*) are user friendly; just grab the (all you can take) fruit ∧ vegetable bags to use for garbage collection
constant shopping:
	daily:
		cans; prefer protein ∧ shake before you buy (if it's not watery inside, then it's probably fermented)
		soy milk; try to get one c̄out the debris (try different brands, ordered economically)
		fresh ∧ raw:
			carrot; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
			orange; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
			banana; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
			chilli; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
			avocado; how does anyone tell if these are good?!? try not to get a stringy one!?!
	trimonthly:
		vegvit (from the cruelty free shop); it's the most cheapest ∧ optimal, including 100% iodine ∧ vitamins∈{d,a,c,..} ∧.. (healthyessentials has more of less)
variable shopping:
	rice
	Ω flaxseed oil
	iodised salt

todo:
	write a shopping list generator to decide "-thing"s like cans
	it should be over-ride-able
	log what i buy
	…
	write a task list generator to decide what i do for the day
	it should read from a list that could be a combination of c*f*g* files ∧ user input; "what do you want to do today?"
	it can r*n*g* one from the list ∧ display the selection, followed by the unselected; i choose which to do though
	log what i do; start ∧ finish ∧ note-worthy comments, to compare "-thing"s like productivity
