daily shopping:
	cans; prefer protein ∧ shake before you buy (if it's not watery inside, then it's probably fermented)
	fresh ∧ raw:
		carrot; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
		orange; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
		banana; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
		chilli; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
		avocado; how does anyone tell if these are good?!?
		soy milk
shopping:
	rice
	Ω flaxseed oil
	iodised salt

TODO:
	write a shopping list generator to decide "-thing"s like cans
	it should be over-ride-able
	log what i buy
	…
	write a task list generator to decide what i do for the day
	it should read from a list that could be a combination of c*f*g* files ∧ user input; "what do you want to do today?"
	it can r*n*g* one from the list ∧ display the selection, followed by the unselected; i choose which to do though
	log what i do; start ∧ finish ∧ note-worthy comments, to compare "-thing"s like productivity
