kōan shopping:
	never buy bulk; buy one ∧ if it's no good, buy another from elsewhere
	some parsimonious places (CBR) won't give you bags for free, but other places (SYD) are user friendly; just grab the (all you can take) fruit ∧ vegetable bags to use for garbage collection
constant shopping:
	cans; prefer protein ∧ shake before you buy (if it's not watery inside, then it's probably fermented)
	soy milk; try to get one c̄out the debris (try different brands, ordered economically)
	fresh ∧ raw:
		carrot; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
		orange; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
		banana; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
		chilli; hey good lookins, what's cookins?
		avocado; how does anyone tell if these are good?!? try not to get a stringy one!?!
variable shopping:
	rice
	Ω flaxseed oil
	iodised salt

TODO:
	write a shopping list generator to decide "-thing"s like cans
	it should be over-ride-able
	log what i buy
	…
	write a task list generator to decide what i do for the day
	it should read from a list that could be a combination of c*f*g* files ∧ user input; "what do you want to do today?"
	it can r*n*g* one from the list ∧ display the selection, followed by the unselected; i choose which to do though
	log what i do; start ∧ finish ∧ note-worthy comments, to compare "-thing"s like productivity
