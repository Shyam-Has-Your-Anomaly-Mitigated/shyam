1. there has to be a better way than this; no `<br>`, but `#partitions`
2. dotadiw; cron messages append to file, and then `/shyam\_.*/` can read them to me at my convenience (desktop,.. notifications are suboptimal; language needs modifier words, instead of counting blends, portmanteaus,.. as new words; think of language as a keyboard, for shyamskrit)
